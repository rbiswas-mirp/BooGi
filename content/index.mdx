:wave: **Hello!**

**IITM Online B.Sc** is a fully fleged online B.Sc degree in programming and data science. Click [HERE](https://onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/) to visit the site.
For the first time, you can work towards an undergraduate degree / diploma from an IIT regardless of your age or location,
and with a wide range of academic backgrounds.

IITM Online B.Sc Knowledge Base contains every announcement, events, updates etc. from IITM themselves regarding the
online B.Sc degree. We made this because at times, I have seen that many people are not getting important email updates. This site
will be updated regularly and if you want to contribute to this, then please use the contact option from the menu. Make sure to mention
the source and the batch for which the announcement was made.

BooGi is inspired by popular [Gitbook](https://gitbook.com) look and feel.
It offers custom styling and components that enable building beautiful documentation
for projects and products quickly. It follows docs-as-code principles, where
you treat your documentation in the same way as your code.
